UniGet will download all of the latest configs from Unimus allowing use of linux search functions rather than only Unimus ones.
Run with sudo priviledges as this script will need to access /etc/hosts which will substitude the addresses with the filenames.
Simply ssh to the config's filename to ssh to the address of the device.

Requirements:

-token.txt file with the API token

-url.txt file with the URL of Unimus
